                        <p class="paragraph-border white-text text-darken-4">In Outlast, the player assumes the role of investigative journalist Miles Upshur, as he navigates a dilapidated psychiatric hospital in Leadville, Colorado that is overrun by homicidal patients. 
                            The game is played from a first-person perspective and features some stealth gameplay mechanics.
                            <p class="paragraph-border white-text text-darken-4">The player can walk, run, crouch, jump, climb ladders and vault over objects. Unlike most games, however, the player does not have a visible health bar on the screen and is unable to attack enemies. The player must instead rely on stealth tactics such as hiding in lockers, sneaking past enemies, staying in the shadows, and hiding behind or under things to survive. Alternatively, the player can attempt to outrun their pursuer. If the player dies, the game will reset to the most recent checkpoint.</p>

            <p  class="white-text text-darken-4">Red Barrels is the studio behind the immersive indie horror series Outlast, a series that has terrified more than 15 million players worldwide. Based in Montreal, Red Barrel's mission is to create unforgettable experiences that leave the player's blood running cold.</p>
            <p class="white-text text-darken-4">Red Barrels Inc. is a Canadian video game developer based in Montreal. The company was founded by Philippe Morin, David Chateauneuf and Hugo Dallaire in 2011. The three were previously developers for Ubisoft Montreal and EA Montreal, but founded the company after the origination of an original intellectual property by Dallaire in 2010. After leaving their respective workplaces, the team's online presence began in July 2012 and a trailer for the game that became Outlast.</p>

                <p class="white-text text-darken-4">Outlast, the first major release from Red Barrels, is a first-person survival horror game that follows investigative journalist Miles Upshur as he explores Mount Massive Asylum, uncovering dark secrets and facing unimaginable horrors.</p>
                <p class="white-text text-darken-4">The game received critical acclaim for its chilling atmosphere, narrative, and innovative use of stealth gameplay in a horror setting. The Outlast Trials is a first-person psychological horror survival video game developed and published by Red Barrels.</p>
                <p class="white-text text-darken-4">Outlast Trials is the third installment in the Outlast series, serving as a prequel to the first two games and features test subjects in a mysterious Cold War experiment. The game was released on May 18, 2023 via early access for Microsoft Windows. Outlast Trials was announced in December 2017, though no time frame or target platforms were confirmed.[3] During this announcement, Red Barrels said that because they could not easily add downloadable content for Outlast 2 due to its structure, they have a smaller separate project related to Outlast that will release before Outlast Outlast Trials. Red Barrels also described the game as a "TV series". The development team of the game had around 40 people.</p>
